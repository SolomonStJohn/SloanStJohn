## Overview of Project Objectives
For this project, I want to explore Business Intelligence (BI), which is typically understood as a process that includes some or all of the following steps: aggregating and organizing raw data, storing it in a database or data warehouse, and running structured queries to generate insights related to business operations, efficiency, and productivity. These insights are then translated into charts and visualizations that can be used across the organization to inform decisions and update business processes and procedures.
For me, BI feels relatively straightforward at the programming level but challenging at the abstract level. Asking the right questions and presenting findings in a clear and meaningful way requires intuition, creativity, planning, and strong communication. Through this project, I hope to develop not only a better understanding of the technical mechanics of BI, but also some intuition and heuristics that will be useful as I pursue this field and potentially informative to other students learning BI.

## 11/28/2026 – Week 2
Last week was the first week of the class, so I focused on getting oriented to the structure of the course and clarifying what project I wanted to pursue. I also briefly explored a few BI tools, including Metabase and Google BigQuery.

This week, I hope to start understanding the basic steps of moving from a business question to insights and finally to visualizations. I would like to work through a single, simple mock example from end to end. I am also planning to raise the idea of doing a BI report for the bar where I work. The bar tracks a significant amount of data, and I plan to approach the general manager to see whether I can use some of that data for this project.

One major impediment is BI software, which is often expensive and, for me, difficult to justify at this stage. It is not always clear what value these tools add compared to running SQL queries directly against a database or data warehouse using something like MySQL Workbench, and then building visualizations from the resulting tables. In some cases, it may be even simpler to work directly with CSV or JSON-formatted data.

There is also the possibility that my boss may not be comfortable giving me access to the bar’s data. If that happens, I will need to be prepared to pivot to a different dataset or use an invented or publicly available one.

Because last week was the first week of the course, I am not sure there is much I could have done differently. Motivation was somewhat difficult, largely because I was still searching for a topic that genuinely engaged me. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to focus on BI, but I need to remember that practical, real-world examples are much more motivating for me than purely abstract concepts. Going forward, I need to strike a better balance between conceptual thinking and hands-on, applied work.
